/* i can't figure out how to perform the math correctly. what number do you start with? you can't use variables in place of numbers like in math and i don't know how to change the number every time you click on it. i also don't know how to call back to the number in the alert because the function needs to have the variable inside of it to call back to it. yet i can't do the math and the displaying in one function. */
